# Applate

Applate is a modern Application template that provides
[JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) conformity: JavaScript, API and pre-rendered markup. 

You only have to provide a database. 
gluon automatically creates a REST-API from it, 
extended with a GraphQL-like, JavaScript-friendly Query API.
On the frontend, you get very easy to create Tables and Forms for the standard use cases
so that you can concentrate on creating marvellous user interfaces 
for the heart of your application.
